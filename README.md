# archipelago_wss_proxy
### Note: This is outdated and only really served as a temporary solution to WSS Archipelago servers for A Hat in Time. A new and much better AP client is now packaged with .apworld releases.
Just a simple middleware script to allow WS only clients to connect to WSS only servers.
